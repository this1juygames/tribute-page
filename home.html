            <ul>
                <li><strong>1816</strong>
                    -Abraham Lincoln is born in a one-room cabin in the woods near Hodgenville, Kentucky, the son of Thomas and Nancy Hanks Lincoln. He is one of three children, but his brother dies as an infant.

                </li>
                <li><strong>1818-19</strong>
                    -When Lincoln is nine years old, his mother passes away. The following year, his father remarries, and Abraham forms a good relationship with his stepmother. Despite both his father and stepmother having limited reading skills, his stepmother supports his desire to learn. Although he seldom attends school, he has a deep love for reading.
                </li>
                <li><strong>1830</strong>
                    -At age 21, Lincoln helps his family move to Illinois by driving their team of oxen on the 200-mile (320-kilometer) journey. In the following years, he works splitting rails (cutting logs to make fences), as a postmaster, and as a member of a boat crew.
                </li>
                <li><strong>1832-34</strong>
                    -Lincoln runs for his first political office in the Illinois state legislature but loses. However, in 1834, he wins the election on his second attempt and subsequently gets reelected three more times.
                </li>
                <li><strong>November 4, 1842</strong>
                    -At age 33, Lincoln marries 23-year-old Mary Todd after a long courtship and a broken engagement. They go on to have four sons, only one of whom lives to adulthood.
                </li>
                <li><strong>1846-49</strong>
                    -Lincoln wins election to the U.S. House of Representatives. During his two-year term, he introduces legislation to end slavery in the District of Columbia.

                <li><strong>1860</strong>
                    -Lincoln wins the presidency on November 6, defeating three other candidates. Alarm spreads through the Southern states. They fear that Lincoln will abolish slavery. They decide to secede from, or leave, the Union. South Carolina becomes the first state to secede from the Union on December 20.
                </li>
                <li><strong>1861-64</strong>
                    -The American Civil War rages on, claiming up to 850,000 lives due to battle and disease. Despite the Union having more people and soldiers, the Confederates achieve early military victories. Eventually, the Union prevails. Lincoln earns the nickname “The Great Emancipator” for his pivotal role in the emancipation of the slaves. He also wins reelection in 1864
                </li>

                    -Pro-slavery advocate John Wilkes Booth shoots Lincoln during a theater performance. Lincoln dies the next morning. “Now he belongs to the ages,” his secretary of war, Edwin Stanton, reportedly says.
